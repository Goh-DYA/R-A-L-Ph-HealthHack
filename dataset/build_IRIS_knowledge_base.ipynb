This reduces risk of fatty deposit build up in your blood vessels and thus reduces risk for heart attack and stroke. \\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Indication Information for Atorvastatin\\n\\n## Indication 1: Hyperlipidemia (HLD)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nHyperlipidemia which is also known as high blood cholesterol, occurs when there is high cholesterol present in the blood. This causes a buildup of fatty deposits on the inside walls of the blood vessels (atherosclerotic plaques), resulting in blockage and restricted blood flow through these blood vessels. It is is one of the main risk factors for coronary heart disease and stroke.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nCholesterol is carried in the bloodstream by lipoproteins. The two main types of lipoproteins are the low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol from the liver to different parts of the body where they are needed. It has the tendency to deposit cholesterol onto the walls of the blood vessels, leading to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. LDL-cholesterol is known as the \"bad\" cholesterol. Lowering the level of LDL cholesterol can reduce our risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. However, the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries excess cholesterol from the different parts of the body to the liver and is known as the \"good\" cholesterol. High levels of HDL cholesterol may help to reduce our risk of heart disease or stroke.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nOur liver produces 80% of our body\\'s cholesterol. The other 20% comes from the food that we eat. Cholesterol is found in foods of animal origin (egg yolk, poultry, seafood and whole milk dairy products). Food of plant origin (vegetable, fruits, grains, cereals) contains no cholesterol. Increased dietary intake of cholesterol and fat may affect your blood cholesterol levels. Besides diet, other factors that affect cholesterol levels are hereditary metabolic disorders, certain Illnesses, obesity, lack of physical activity or a sedentary lifestyle.\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol:\\n1. Eat Less Fat\\n- Cut down on the amount of fat in your diet in general.\\n- Cut down on the amount of saturated fat. This is found mainly in animal products such as meat, fat, poultry skin, full cream milk, milk products, butter and ghee, and in plant products such as coconut milk, palm oil and certain types of non-dairy creamer.\\n- Read food labels to watch out for saturated fat in the ingredients.\\n- Eat skinless poultry, fish, lean meats and low-fat dairy products.\\n- Choose monounsaturated oils such as olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil or polyunsaturated oils such as corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil in cooking.\\n2. Eat Less High Cholesterol Food\\n- Eat smaller quantities of foods containing cholesterol, which is found in foods of animal origin.\\n- Avoid organ meats (liver, kidney, brain and innards) or eat them in small portions as these have high cholesterol content.\\n- Replace meat with bean curds, peas and beans on some days.\\n- Eat less seafood such as squid.\\n- Limit to 3-5 egg yolks a week if your blood cholesterol level is normal. If it is high, you should not take -more than 3 egg yolks a week.\\n3. Eat More Fibre\\n-Eat more fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, and legumes.\\n-Foods containing soluble fibres like oats, barley, beans, peas are good in reducing cholesterol.\\n4. Do not smoke as smoking harms your blood vessels and lowers your HDL-cholesterol.\\n5. Lose weight if you are overweight. Aim for a healthy weight range of Body Mass Index (BMI) from 18.5 to 23kg/m2\\n6. Adopt a active lifestyle which helps to increase HDL-cholesterol. Aim for 150minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing or as advised by your doctor\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Administration Instructions\\n- You may take this medication before food or after food. \\n- Dosage form: tablet\\n- Can it be crushed: Yes\\nNone\\n\\n# Medication Storage\\nStore your medication in a cool, dry place away from heat, moisture and direct sunlight, such as in a cupboard\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Pregnancy & Breastfeeding Considerations\\n- Pregnancy: Statins can cause harm to the fetus and should not be used in pregnancy.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\BISOPROLOL.docx'}, page_content='Drug: BISOPROLOL\\n\\n# Available Drug Strengths\\nBISOPROLOL 2.5MG TAB;\\nBISOPROLOL 5MG TAB\\n\\n# Mechanism of Action & How it Works / Helps\\nBisoprolol belongs to a group of medications known as beta-blockers and can be used in the treatment of different conditions. They include, high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, reduce chest pain/ discomfort (angina symptoms), heart failure, reduce symptoms such as tremors and fast heart rate in people with hyperthyroidism.\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Indication Information for Bisoprolol\\n\\n## Indication 1: Hypertension (HTN)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nHigh blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a condition in which the heart has to pump harder for blood to flow through narrowed blood vessels, leading to persistently raised pressure. It usually does not have any noticeable signs, but it can be harmful to your health if not managed. If left unchecked or untreated, it can damage your blood vessels, heart, kidney, eye or other organs over time and cause serious complications.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nBlood pressure refers to the force of the body\\'s blood pushing against the inner walls of the blood vessels, especially the arteries. Each time the heart contracts, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure doesn\\'t stay constant throughout the day. It is lowest when you\\'re sleeping, and rises when you get up and start moving about. It can also go up when you are excited, nervous or physically active. \\nBlood pressure (BP) readings are expressed as a ratio of the systolic pressure (the first number or numerator), over the diastolic pressure (the second number or denominator). A blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg (millimetres of mercury) is expressed verbally as 120 over 80.\\nA healthy blood pressure reading should be lower than 120/80 mmHg. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg diastolic, and may vary from 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg in a healthy young woman. A blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher indicates high blood pressure.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nThe most common type of high blood pressure is essential hypertension, and it develops over time, usually aused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle-related risk factors. \\nAge\\nAs we grow older, our arteries may stiffen and narrow due to the build-up of plaque over the years, causing the heart to beat harder, thus developing high blood pressure.\\nSmoking\\nSmoking can raise our blood pressure temporarily and its chemicals can damage our artery walls, causing our arteries to narrow and stiffen.\\nUnhealthy Diet\\nA diet high in fat, sugar, or sodium can increase our risk of developing hypertension.\\nPhysical Inactivity\\nIndividuals who lead sedentary lifestyles tend to have a higher heart rate than those who are physically active. This means that the heart needs to work harder.\\nObesity/Overweight\\nThe heavier we are, the more blood is required to supply oxygen and nutrients around our body, thus increasing the pressure on our blood vessels.\\nAlcohol Consumption\\nDrinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure to unhealthy levels. Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily increase blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increased blood pressure.\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have high blood pressure:\\n1. Stick to a Healthy Diet. Avoid foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats such as animal fats, red meat (e.g. beef and lamb), coconut milk, palm oil.\\nInstead, choose lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products.\\nIncrease your intake of fruits and vegetables.\\nLimit salt intake to 2,000 mg of sodium per day, or about 1 teaspoon (about 5g) of salt daily.\\n2. Exercise Regularly. Aim for at least 150 minutes light to moderate activity per week, 30 mins per day. Walking, swimming, dancing - anything that gets your heart pumping counts.\\n3. Watch Your Weight. It has been proven that maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risk of high blood pressure.\\n4. Quit Smoking. Not only can smoking raise your blood pressure, but it\\'s also a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke.\\n\\n## Indication 2: Atrial Fibrillation (AF)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterised by rapid and irregular beating.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nIt is the most common heart rhythm problem and can occur in patients of any age though it is more commonly seen in older patients. AF is not immediately life-threatening but may result in heart failure. AF also predisposes a patient to blood clot formation. In an event of clot embolisation from the heart to the brain, a stroke occurs.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nThis is caused by unusual electrical activity in the upper chambers (atria) of the heart which causes the lower chambers (ventricles) to beat quickly and irregularly.\\nRisk factors include: existing heart conditions such as coronary artery disease and past heart attacks, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, obesity, excessive alcohol or caffeine, and smoking. People with family history of AF are more likely to suffer from the condition.\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have AF:\\n1. Manage high blood pressure (hypertension): Taking medication and making lifestyle changes to manage hypertension reduces the risk of AF.\\n2. Exercise regularly: Moderate-intensity exercise lowers blood pressure and reduces the risk of coronary artery disease that could lead to development AF.\\n3. Eat a heart healthy diet: Eat more whole grains, vegetables and fruits and cut down on salt and solid fats. This reduces one\\'s risk of medical conditions such as coronary artery disease which are associated with higher risks of experiencing AF.\\n4. Maintain a healthy weight: One should aim to maintain a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) under 27 kg/m2. This will help to reduce the effects or complications associated with AF.\\n5. Smoking cessation: Quitting smoking reduces the risks of AF.\\n6. Managing stress: This reduces one\\'s risk of experiencing an abnormal heart rhythm like AF. \\n7. Reducing alcohol or caffeine consumption: Drinking too much caffeine or alcohol, especially binge drinking, can trigger incidences of AF.\\n\\n## Indication 3: Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nIschaemic heart disease, also known as coronary artery disease (CAD), occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (the coronary arteries) become hardened and narrowed as a result of the build-up of fatty deposits called plaque on their inner walls (atherosclerosis). As a result, it gets harder for the arteries to supply blood to the heart. Eventually, blood flow to the heart muscle is reduced and can cause chest pain (angina). A sudden, complete blockage can lead to a heart attack.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nMany people with this disease are not aware they have it, as it develops slowly and silently over decades. It can go virtually unnoticed until it produces a heart attack. Symptoms of IHD may include:\\nChest pain (angina)\\nShortness of breath\\nHeaviness in the chest\\nPain in the jaw or down the arms\\nHeartburn\\nNausea\\nVomiting\\nHeavy sweating\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nThe narrowing of coronary arteries is typically caused by atherosclerosis. Other contributory factors include spasms in the coronary vessels, diabetes, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, adverse physical reactions to mental stress, and heavy smoking.\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nYou can prevent or slow down coronary artery disease by improving the health of your heart and blood vessels. Here are some heart healthy activities:\\n1. Exercise at least 150 minutes a week, with moderate intensity exercise. Make moderate exercise a part of your daily routine. Regular physical activity is a great way to burn fat. It also releases natural chemicals such as endorphins and vasodilators that help to maintain healthy blood vessels.\\n2. Get six to eight hours of sleep daily.\\n3. Adopt a heart-healthy diet rich in wholegrains and fibre. Take two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables daily.\\n4. Achieve and maintain a healthy BMI (Body Mass Index). The healthy range for Asians is from 18.5 to 22.9 kg/m2.\\nObesity or excess body fat, particularly around the waist, can also be a cause of increased blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.  A 2.5 to 5 kg weight loss can significantly reduce your risk of heart disease.\\n5. Stop or not start on smokingIf you smoke, create a plan to stop. Smoking decreases the amount of oxygen delivered to the heart, and increases the risk of developing deadly blood clots. There are support groups you can contact to help encourage you, as well as medications to make stopping easier. \\n\\n## Indication 4: Heart Failure (HF)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nThe heart is a very important organ that pumps blood to all parts of the body. In the more common cases of heart failure, the heart is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s demands. Due to the abnormal function of the heart, patients with heart failure experience may experience other symptoms too, for example, difficulty breathing, fatigue, water retention, and high blood pressure. When left untreated, heart failure will worsen over time.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nThere are two main ways by which heart function can become abnormal:\\nMore commonly, the heart which is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s demands. Any disease condition or injury to the heart muscles, heart valves or electrical conduction system of the heart can damage and weaken the heart causing heart failure.\\nAnother way is a stiff heart that is unable to fill properly with blood even though it may still be able to \"pump\" well. This situation leads to increased pressures within the heart chambers and eventually in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing heart failure.\\nBoth conditions eventually cause a decrease in cardiac output and inadequate blood supply to the rest of the body. When this occurs, the body will compensate for the lack of blood supply through a number of ways.\\nFor instance, certain hormones and the nervous system (also known as the neurohormonal systems) become active, making the injured heart contract harder and faster. These systems also cause the kidneys to retain salt and fluid in order to increase blood volume, and also make the blood vessels in the body and limbs become narrower to increase blood pressure. While these processes may initially improve the heart function and cardiac output, in the long run, they damage the body and the heart, particularly if the heart remains injured. Altogether, these processes produce the syndrome of heart failure.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nOne or a combination of these various conditions can cause the heart to function inefficiently:\\n- Heart muscle damage due to heart attack or when the heart arteries become severely narrowed\\n- Poorly controlled long-term high blood pressure\\n- Faulty heart valves\\n- Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle due to genetic causes, or damage to the heart muscle by external causes like a virus or alcohol)\\n- Congenital heart disease (heart defects present since birth)\\n- Infection of the heart and/or heart valves\\n- Arrhythmia (heart rhythm disorder)\\n- Certain toxins (alcohol, cocaine, certain chemotherapy drugs)\\n- Other medical conditions (e.g. thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions, tumours affecting the heart, etc)\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have heart failure:\\n1. Eat less salt, cholesterol-rich food and saturated fat. Avoid egg yolks, organ meats, seafood (e.g. squid) as they contain high amounts of dietary cholesterol. Choose the healthier types of fat (unsaturated fats such as olive oil, corn oil and sunflower oil instead of saturated such as coconut oil). \\n2. Eat more fibre as a high fibre diet (particularly soluble fibre) will improve your blood cholesterol level. Good sources of fibre are vegetables, fruits and whole grain\\n3. You may need to limit your fluid intake if instructed by your doctor.\\n4. Quit smoking if possible and limit alcohol beverages if possible.\\n5. Many people can continue to carry out their daily activities and lead a relatively normal lifestyle, despite having a heart condition. If you had a recent heart failure event,  it is important that you return to your previous home, leisure and work activities gradually to help your heart to heal. Some energy conservation techniques you can try are:\\nApproach your day calmly.\\nAllow enough time for each task so that you do not have to rush.\\nPlan realistically and prioritise the things you need to do for the day.\\nTake short breaks and rest between tasks, even when not feeling tired\\n \\n6. Remain active as much as possible and continue to do the activities you enjoy. Heart failure can cause symptoms of breathlessness on exertion and muscle tiredness, thus do consult your doctor or therapist for the kind of exercise(s) that you can do safely and avoid overexertion. You may also find out more about cardiac rehabilitation, supervised exercise training and educational programmes.\\n7. Monitor your weight daily as rapid weight gain may be a sign that you are retaining fluid or that your heart failure condition is getting worse. Try to weigh yourself in the morning (at the same time each day), after emptying your bladder and before breakfast. Wear the same amount of clothes each time you weigh yourself and record it daily in your diary or chart. Use the same weighing scale. Watch for sudden weight gain and contact your doctor if you suddenly gain more than 1 kg of weight a day for three days.\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Administration Instructions\\n- You may take this medication before food or after food. \\n- Dosage form: tablet\\n- Can it be crushed: Yes\\nNone\\n\\n# Medication Storage\\nStore your medication in a cool, dry place away from heat, moisture and direct sunlight, such as in a cupboard\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Pregnancy & Breastfeeding Considerations\\n- Pregnancy: Please inform your healthcare professional if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding\\n- Breastfeeding: Please inform your healthcare professional if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Side Effects of Bisoprolol\\n\\n## Side Effect 1: Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension)\\n\\n### Likelihood of side effect\\nCommon\\n\\n### Side effect symptoms\\nGiddiness or light-headedness, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position\\n\\n### Management of side effects\\nThis is more likely to happen in the morning or when you first get out of bed.

SGLT2 inhibitors work by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing sugar (glucose) back into the blood, and this increases the amount of sugar that is removed in the urine. It works together with lifestyle changes, such as having a healthy diet and regular exercise, to reduce blood sugar levels. \\nIf you suffer from heart failure, this medication can also be given to you to help with your heart condition, even if you do not have diabetes.\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Indication Information for Empagliflozin\\n\\n## Indication 1: Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nDiabetes means your blood sugar level is higher than normal. Type 2 Diabetes, is usually found in people aged 40 and above who are overweight and physically inactive. In some people, the condition is mild and they are able to control their blood glucose with just diet and exercise. However, if the condition gets worse, they may require oral medication or insulin injections in addition to making lifestyle changes.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nPeople with Type 2 diabetes can feel well and not experience any symptoms at all. However, there may also be symptoms that develop gradually and are sometimes so mild they go unnoticed, such as the following: Having blurred vision, feeling thirsty despite drinking lots of water, poor healing of cuts and wounds, feeling tired, feeling hungry all the time, losing weight despite good appetite or frequent urination. The high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) levels in uncontrolled diabetes can damage both nerves and blood vessels. As blood vessels supply blood to various organs, this can eventually lead to complications such as: \\nKidney disease\\nFoot disease such as numbness, ulcers, and even gangrene\\nEye disease\\nNerve disease which can lead to problems such as erectile dysfunction and diarrhoea\\nHeart disease such as angina and heart attack\\nStroke\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nType 2 Diabetes usually occurs when the body\\'s cells do not respond well or are resistant to the body\\'s own insulin. It is commonly associated with being overweight and having excessive body fat (under the skin and around the internal organs). Typically, it develops in older adults (risk increases for those above 40 years).\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have diabetes:\\n1. Lose weight if you are overweight. Aim for a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging from 18.5 to 22.9kg/m2 to reduce the risk of heart disease and insulin resistance. \\n2. Maintain an active lifestyle. This helps to maintain healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\\n3. Follow the healthy plate concept which helps you remember the right proportions of each food group in a well-balanced meal. Here\\'s how:\\nFill Quarter plate with wholegrains\\nFill Quarter plate with good sources of protein\\nFill Half plate with fruit and vegetables\\n4. Eat more fibre-rich food. Fibre helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is being released into the bloodstream, keeps you full and improves bowel function.\\nInclude two servings each of fruit and vegetables daily.\\n1 serving of fruit = 1 small apple or 1 wedge papaya or 10 grapes (small)\\n1 serving of vegetables = 100g cooked vegetables (¾ mug) or 150g raw vegetable\\n4. Include wholegrain products in your diet such as wholegrain or whole-meal bread, oats, chapati, brown rice, whole-meal biscuits etc.\\n5. Have regular meals at similar timings each day. This provides a regular and constant amount of sugar from the food you eat to reduce fluctuations in your blood sugar level.\\nThis is also important for those on medications and/or insulin therapy to allow the action of the medication/insulin to match your food intake, hence preventing hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).\\n6. Quit smoking as smoking increases insulin resistance, risk of diabetes and its complications.\\n\\n## Indication 2: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is due to the gradual loss of the kidneys\\' filtering ability, usually due to high blood pressure or diabetes. When kidney function is seriously impaired, dangerously high levels of fluid and wastes can accumulate in the body.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nOur kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining the body\\'s internal balance by adjusting the composition of the urine they produce, and are critical for our survival. 1) They regulate the amount of salt and water in the body, ensuring proper fluid balance, and 2) they eliminate waste products from the body through urine, helping to cleanse the system. Additionally, 3) the kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which is essential for the formation of adequate red blood cells. 4)They also contribute to bone health by converting vitamin D into its active form and regulating calcium and phosphate levels. 5) The kidneys help maintain the body\\'s chemical balance by controlling acid levels and managing various minerals and salts.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nThere are many reasons why a kidney stops working. Diabetes and high blood pressure are two major causes of kidney disease. Other risk factors include a family history of kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, older age and abnormal kidney structure. For many people, kidney failure is often the result of complications caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. Diabetic nephropathy is kidney failure resulting from long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes. When diabetes is poorly controlled and blood sugar levels are high, the kidney have to work extra hard to filter the blood, causing damage to the blood vessels in the kidney and decline in its filtering ability over time.\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nThe main goal of CKD treatment is to halt or delay the progression of the disease, usually by controlling the underlying cause such as controlling high blood pressure and diabetes. CKD can progressively worsen over time and end up with kidney failure, which can be fatal if not treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. \\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have CKD:\\n1. Opt for less sugar, salt, and fats when dining out. Consider home cooked meals to better control the amount of sugar and salt. Have a healthy diet with at least 2 servings of fruits and 2 servings of vegetables every day. Consider whole grains and lean meat.\\n2. When kidney function starts to decrease, CKD patients may need to adjust their diet to prevent excess waste and fluid from building up. Diet modification varies for individuals due to their age, body size, symptoms, stage of CKD, activity level, and other health conditions. It is thus important to discuss with your doctor or dietician,  for example regarding the right amount of protein, phosphorous, potassium, sodium and fluids you should be consuming.   \\n3. Quit smoking and limit alcohol. Smoking can damage your blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to the kidneys and reduce their ability to function normally. Smoking can also increase the risk of developing kidney cancer. Drinking too much alcohol can also increase blood pressure over time, which is one of the common causes of kidney disease.\\n4. Maintain an active lifestyle to maintain a healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\\n\\n## Indication 3: Heart Failure (HF)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nThe heart is a very important organ that pumps blood to all parts of the body. In the more common cases of heart failure, the heart is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s demands. Due to the abnormal function of the heart, patients with heart failure experience may experience other symptoms too, for example, difficulty breathing, fatigue, water retention, and high blood pressure. When left untreated, heart failure will worsen over time.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nThere are two main ways by which heart function can become abnormal:\\nMore commonly, the heart which is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s demands. Any disease condition or injury to the heart muscles, heart valves or electrical conduction system of the heart can damage and weaken the heart causing heart failure.\\nAnother way is a stiff heart that is unable to fill properly with blood even though it may still be able to \"pump\" well. This situation leads to increased pressures within the heart chambers and eventually in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing heart failure.\\nBoth conditions eventually cause a decrease in cardiac output and inadequate blood supply to the rest of the body. When this occurs, the body will compensate for the lack of blood supply through a number of ways.\\nFor instance, certain hormones and the nervous system (also known as the neurohormonal systems) become active, making the injured heart contract harder and faster. These systems also cause the kidneys to retain salt and fluid in order to increase blood volume, and also make the blood vessels in the body and limbs become narrower to increase blood pressure. While these processes may initially improve the heart function and cardiac output, in the long run, they damage the body and the heart, particularly if the heart remains injured. Altogether, these processes produce the syndrome of heart failure.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nOne or a combination of these various conditions can cause the heart to function inefficiently:\\n- Heart muscle damage due to heart attack or when the heart arteries become severely narrowed\\n- Poorly controlled long-term high blood pressure\\n- Faulty heart valves\\n- Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle due to genetic causes, or damage to the heart muscle by external causes like a virus or alcohol)\\n- Congenital heart disease (heart defects present since birth)\\n- Infection of the heart and/or heart valves\\n- Arrhythmia (heart rhythm disorder)\\n- Certain toxins (alcohol, cocaine, certain chemotherapy drugs)\\n- Other medical conditions (e.g. thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions, tumours affecting the heart, etc)\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have heart failure:\\n1. Eat less salt, cholesterol-rich food and saturated fat. Avoid egg yolks, organ meats, seafood (e.g. squid) as they contain high amounts of dietary cholesterol. Choose the healthier types of fat (unsaturated fats such as olive oil, corn oil and sunflower oil instead of saturated such as coconut oil). \\n2. Eat more fibre as a high fibre diet (particularly soluble fibre) will improve your blood cholesterol level. Good sources of fibre are vegetables, fruits and whole grain\\n3. You may need to limit your fluid intake if instructed by your doctor.\\n4. Quit smoking if possible and limit alcohol beverages if possible.\\n5. Many people can continue to carry out their daily activities and lead a relatively normal lifestyle, despite having a heart condition. If you had a recent heart failure event,  it is important that you return to your previous home, leisure and work activities gradually to help your heart to heal. Some energy conservation techniques you can try are:\\nApproach your day calmly.\\nAllow enough time for each task so that you do not have to rush.\\nPlan realistically and prioritise the things you need to do for the day.\\nTake short breaks and rest between tasks, even when not feeling tired\\n \\n6. Remain active as much as possible and continue to do the activities you enjoy. Heart failure can cause symptoms of breathlessness on exertion and muscle tiredness, thus do consult your doctor or therapist for the kind of exercise(s) that you can do safely and avoid overexertion. You may also find out more about cardiac rehabilitation, supervised exercise training and educational programmes.\\n7. Monitor your weight daily as rapid weight gain may be a sign that you are retaining fluid or that your heart failure condition is getting worse. Try to weigh yourself in the morning (at the same time each day), after emptying your bladder and before breakfast. Wear the same amount of clothes each time you weigh yourself and record it daily in your diary or chart. Use the same weighing scale. Watch for sudden weight gain and contact your doctor if you suddenly gain more than 1 kg of weight a day for three days.\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Administration Instructions\\n- You may take this medication before food or after food. \\n- Dosage form: tablet\\n- Can it be crushed: Yes\\n\\n# Counselling Points for Empagliflozin\\n\\n## Counselling Point 1: Sick Day Dosing\\nTemporarily stop if experiencing acute illness, especially when you have very poor appetite\\n\\n## Counselling Point 2: Fasting Blood Glucose Testing\\nIf you need to do fasting blood tests, do not take your medication until your blood has been taken and you have eaten.\\n\\n## Counselling Point 3: Procedures\\nIf you have planned surgery and procedures, please inform your healthcare professional.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) means having a higher level of this fat content in the blood. This increases risk of atherosclerosis (fatty deposits building up inside the arteries, narrowing them and restricting blood flow) and related heart diseases. Severe hypertriglyceridemia may face an increased risk of acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). \\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nHypertriglyceridemia is not the same as high cholesterol, although both conditions relate to lipid levels in your blood. Lipids are fatty substances that perform important jobs in your body. Triglycerides and cholesterol are both types of lipids that travel through your blood. Hypertriglyceridemia means you have too many triglycerides in your blood, while hypercholesterolemia means you have too much cholesterol.\\nMany people who have hypertriglyceridemia may also have high total cholesterol.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nHypertriglyceridemia has many causes, including\\nLifestyle factors (too much alcohol, saturated fats, refined carbohydrates (like white bread) or sugar)\\nUnderlying medical conditions (Diabetes, Hypothyroidism, Insulin resistance, Kidney disease, Liver disease)\\nMedications that can raise your triglycerides\\nGenetic lipid disorders\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nManagement of hypertriglyceridaemia is similar to the management of high cholesterol. Here are some lifestyle tips:\\n1. Lead an active lifestyle and aim to lose weight if you are overweight. Aim for a healthy weight range of Body Mass Index (BMI) from 18.5 to 23kg/m2. Consider 150minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing or as advised by your doctor. Exercising helps to increase the levels of your good cholesterol (HDL).\\n2. Eat healthily to keep high cholesterol at bay. Limit total fat intake and replace unhealthy types of fat (saturated and trans fat) in your diet with healthier fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat).\\n3. Do not smoke.

Type 2 Diabetes, is usually found in people aged 40 and above who are overweight and physically inactive. In some people, the condition is mild and they are able to control their blood glucose with just diet and exercise. However, if the condition gets worse, they may require oral medication or insulin injections in addition to making lifestyle changes.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nPeople with Type 2 diabetes can feel well and not experience any symptoms at all. However, there may also be symptoms that develop gradually and are sometimes so mild they go unnoticed, such as the following: Having blurred vision, feeling thirsty despite drinking lots of water, poor healing of cuts and wounds, feeling tired, feeling hungry all the time, losing weight despite good appetite or frequent urination. The high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) levels in uncontrolled diabetes can damage both nerves and blood vessels. As blood vessels supply blood to various organs, this can eventually lead to complications such as: \\nKidney disease\\nFoot disease such as numbness, ulcers, and even gangrene\\nEye disease\\nNerve disease which can lead to problems such as erectile dysfunction and diarrhoea\\nHeart disease such as angina and heart attack\\nStroke\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nType 2 Diabetes usually occurs when the body's cells do not respond well or are resistant to the body's own insulin. It is commonly associated with being overweight and having excessive body fat (under the skin and around the internal organs).

If left unchecked or untreated, it can damage your blood vessels, heart, kidney, eye or other organs over time and cause serious complications.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nBlood pressure refers to the force of the body's blood pushing against the inner walls of the blood vessels, especially the arteries. Each time the heart contracts, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure doesn't stay constant throughout the day. It is lowest when you're sleeping, and rises when you get up and start moving about. It can also go up when you are excited, nervous or physically active. \\nBlood pressure (BP) readings are expressed as a ratio of the systolic pressure (the first number or numerator), over the diastolic pressure (the second number or denominator). A blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg (millimetres of mercury) is expressed verbally as 120 over 80.\\nA healthy blood pressure reading should be lower than 120/80 mmHg. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg diastolic, and may vary from 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg in a healthy young woman. A blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher indicates high blood pressure.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nThe most common type of high blood pressure is essential hypertension, and it develops over time, usually aused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle-related risk factors. \\nAge\\nAs we grow older, our arteries may stiffen and narrow due to the build-up of plaque over the years, causing the heart to beat harder, thus developing high blood pressure.\\nSmoking\\nSmoking can raise our blood pressure temporarily and its chemicals can damage our artery walls, causing our arteries to narrow and stiffen.\\nUnhealthy Diet\\nA diet high in fat, sugar, or sodium can increase our risk of developing hypertension.\\nPhysical Inactivity\\nIndividuals who lead sedentary lifestyles tend to have a higher heart rate than those who are physically active. This means that the heart needs to work harder.\\nObesity/Overweight\\nThe heavier we are, the more blood is required to supply oxygen and nutrients around our body, thus increasing the pressure on our blood vessels.\\nAlcohol Consumption\\nDrinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure to unhealthy levels. Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily increase blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increased blood pressure.\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have high blood pressure:\\n1. Stick to a Healthy Diet. Avoid foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats such as animal fats, red meat (e.g. beef and lamb), coconut milk, palm oil.\\nInstead, choose lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products.\\nIncrease your intake of fruits and vegetables.\\nLimit salt intake to 2,000 mg of sodium per day, or about 1 teaspoon (about 5g) of salt daily.\\n2. Exercise Regularly. Aim for at least 150 minutes light to moderate activity per week, 30 mins per day. Walking, swimming, dancing - anything that gets your heart pumping counts.\\n3. Watch Your Weight. It has been proven that maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risk of high blood pressure.\\n4. Quit Smoking. Not only can smoking raise your blood pressure, but it's also a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke.\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Administration Instructions\\n- You may take this medication before food or after food. \\n- Dosage form: tablet\\n- Can it be crushed: Yes\\nNone\\n\\n# Medication Storage\\nStore your medication in a cool, dry place away from heat, moisture and direct sunlight, such as in a cupboard\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Pregnancy & Breastfeeding Considerations\\n- Pregnancy: Lisinopril is not recommended in pregnancy.

It also decreases the amount of sugar made by your liver, therefore reducing your sugar levels in the blood. It works together with lifestyle changes, such as having a healthy diet and regular exercise,  to reduce blood sugar levels.\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Indication Information for Metformin\\n\\n## Indication 1: Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nDiabetes means your blood sugar level is higher than normal. Type 2 Diabetes, is usually found in people aged 40 and above who are overweight and physically inactive. In some people, the condition is mild and they are able to control their blood glucose with just diet and exercise. However, if the condition gets worse, they may require oral medication or insulin injections in addition to making lifestyle changes.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nPeople with Type 2 diabetes can feel well and not experience any symptoms at all. However, there may also be symptoms that develop gradually and are sometimes so mild they go unnoticed, such as the following: Having blurred vision, feeling thirsty despite drinking lots of water, poor healing of cuts and wounds, feeling tired, feeling hungry all the time, losing weight despite good appetite or frequent urination. The high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) levels in uncontrolled diabetes can damage both nerves and blood vessels. As blood vessels supply blood to various organs, this can eventually lead to complications such as: \\nKidney disease\\nFoot disease such as numbness, ulcers, and even gangrene\\nEye disease\\nNerve disease which can lead to problems such as erectile dysfunction and diarrhoea\\nHeart disease such as angina and heart attack\\nStroke\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nType 2 Diabetes usually occurs when the body's cells do not respond well or are resistant to the body's own insulin. It is commonly associated with being overweight and having excessive body fat (under the skin and around the internal organs). Typically, it develops in older adults (risk increases for those above 40 years).\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have diabetes:\\n1. Lose weight if you are overweight. Aim for a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging from 18.5 to 22.9kg/m2 to reduce the risk of heart disease and insulin resistance. \\n2. Maintain an active lifestyle. This helps to maintain healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\\n3. Follow the healthy plate concept which helps you remember the right proportions of each food group in a well-balanced meal. Here's how:\\nFill Quarter plate with wholegrains\\nFill Quarter plate with good sources of protein\\nFill Half plate with fruit and vegetables\\n4. Eat more fibre-rich food. Fibre helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is being released into the bloodstream, keeps you full and improves bowel function.\\nInclude two servings each of fruit and vegetables daily.\\n1 serving of fruit = 1 small apple or 1 wedge papaya or 10 grapes (small)\\n1 serving of vegetables = 100g cooked vegetables (¾ mug) or 150g raw vegetable\\n4. Include wholegrain products in your diet such as wholegrain or whole-meal bread, oats, chapati, brown rice, whole-meal biscuits etc.\\n5. Have regular meals at similar timings each day. This provides a regular and constant amount of sugar from the food you eat to reduce fluctuations in your blood sugar level.\\nThis is also important for those on medications and/or insulin therapy to allow the action of the medication/insulin to match your food intake, hence preventing hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).\\n6.

Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily increase blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increased blood pressure.\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have high blood pressure:\\n1. Stick to a Healthy Diet. Avoid foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats such as animal fats, red meat (e.g. beef and lamb), coconut milk, palm oil.\\nInstead, choose lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products.\\nIncrease your intake of fruits and vegetables.\\nLimit salt intake to 2,000 mg of sodium per day, or about 1 teaspoon (about 5g) of salt daily.\\n2. Exercise Regularly. Aim for at least 150 minutes light to moderate activity per week, 30 mins per day. Walking, swimming, dancing - anything that gets your heart pumping counts.\\n3. Watch Your Weight. It has been proven that maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risk of high blood pressure.\\n4. Quit Smoking. Not only can smoking raise your blood pressure, but it's also a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke.\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Administration Instructions\\n- You may take this medication before food or after food. \\n- Dosage form: tablet\\n- Can it be crushed: Yes\\nNone\\n\\n# Medication Storage\\nStore in original packaging at room temperature in a cool dry place, away from direct heat and sunlight\\n\\n###CHUNK_DELIMITER###\\n\\n# Pregnancy & Breastfeeding Considerations\\n- Pregnancy: Telmisartan can cause harm to the fetus should not be used in pregnancy.

This reduces risk of fatty deposit build up in your blood vessels and thus reduces risk for heart attack and stroke.\n",

      "## Indication 1: Hyperlipidemia (HLD)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "Hyperlipidemia which is also known as high blood cholesterol, occurs when there is high cholesterol present in the blood. This causes a buildup of fatty deposits on the inside walls of the blood vessels (atherosclerotic plaques), resulting in blockage and restricted blood flow through these blood vessels. It is is one of the main risk factors for coronary heart disease and stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "Cholesterol is carried in the bloodstream by lipoproteins. The two main types of lipoproteins are the low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol from the liver to different parts of the body where they are needed. It has the tendency to deposit cholesterol onto the walls of the blood vessels, leading to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. LDL-cholesterol is known as the \"bad\" cholesterol. Lowering the level of LDL cholesterol can reduce our risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. However, the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries excess cholesterol from the different parts of the body to the liver and is known as the \"good\" cholesterol. High levels of HDL cholesterol may help to reduce our risk of heart disease or stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "Our liver produces 80% of our body's cholesterol. The other 20% comes from the food that we eat. Cholesterol is found in foods of animal origin (egg yolk, poultry, seafood and whole milk dairy products). Food of plant origin (vegetable, fruits, grains, cereals) contains no cholesterol. Increased dietary intake of cholesterol and fat may affect your blood cholesterol levels. Besides diet, other factors that affect cholesterol levels are hereditary metabolic disorders, certain Illnesses, obesity, lack of physical activity or a sedentary lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol:\n",
      "1. Eat Less Fat\n",
      "- Cut down on the amount of fat in your diet in general.\n",
      "- Cut down on the amount of saturated fat. This is found mainly in animal products such as meat, fat, poultry skin, full cream milk, milk products, butter and ghee, and in plant products such as coconut milk, palm oil and certain types of non-dairy creamer.\n",
      "- Read food labels to watch out for saturated fat in the ingredients.\n",
      "- Eat skinless poultry, fish, lean meats and low-fat dairy products.\n",
      "- Choose monounsaturated oils such as olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil or polyunsaturated oils such as corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil in cooking.\n",
      "2. Eat Less High Cholesterol Food\n",
      "- Eat smaller quantities of foods containing cholesterol, which is found in foods of animal origin.\n",
      "- Avoid organ meats (liver, kidney, brain and innards) or eat them in small portions as these have high cholesterol content.\n",
      "- Replace meat with bean curds, peas and beans on some days.\n",
      "- Eat less seafood such as squid.\n",
      "- Limit to 3-5 egg yolks a week if your blood cholesterol level is normal. If it is high, you should not take -more than 3 egg yolks a week.\n",
      "3. Eat More Fibre\n",
      "-Eat more fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, and legumes.\n",
      "-Foods containing soluble fibres like oats, barley, beans, peas are good in reducing cholesterol.\n",
      "4. Do not smoke as smoking harms your blood vessels and lowers your HDL-cholesterol.\n",
      "5. Lose weight if you are overweight. Aim for a healthy weight range of Body Mass Index (BMI) from 18.5 to 23kg/m2\n",
      "6. Adopt a active lifestyle which helps to increase HDL-cholesterol. Aim for 150minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing or as advised by your doctor\n",

      "## Indication 1: Hypertension (HTN)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a condition in which the heart has to pump harder for blood to flow through narrowed blood vessels, leading to persistently raised pressure. It usually does not have any noticeable signs, but it can be harmful to your health if not managed. If left unchecked or untreated, it can damage your blood vessels, heart, kidney, eye or other organs over time and cause serious complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "Blood pressure refers to the force of the body's blood pushing against the inner walls of the blood vessels, especially the arteries. Each time the heart contracts, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure doesn't stay constant throughout the day. It is lowest when you're sleeping, and rises when you get up and start moving about. It can also go up when you are excited, nervous or physically active. \n",
      "Blood pressure (BP) readings are expressed as a ratio of the systolic pressure (the first number or numerator), over the diastolic pressure (the second number or denominator). A blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg (millimetres of mercury) is expressed verbally as 120 over 80.\n",
      "A healthy blood pressure reading should be lower than 120/80 mmHg. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg diastolic, and may vary from 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg in a healthy young woman. A blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher indicates high blood pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "The most common type of high blood pressure is essential hypertension, and it develops over time, usually aused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle-related risk factors. \n",
      "Age\n",
      "As we grow older, our arteries may stiffen and narrow due to the build-up of plaque over the years, causing the heart to beat harder, thus developing high blood pressure.\n",
      "Smoking\n",
      "Smoking can raise our blood pressure temporarily and its chemicals can damage our artery walls, causing our arteries to narrow and stiffen.\n",
      "Unhealthy Diet\n",
      "A diet high in fat, sugar, or sodium can increase our risk of developing hypertension.\n",
      "Physical Inactivity\n",
      "Individuals who lead sedentary lifestyles tend to have a higher heart rate than those who are physically active. This means that the heart needs to work harder.\n",
      "Obesity/Overweight\n",
      "The heavier we are, the more blood is required to supply oxygen and nutrients around our body, thus increasing the pressure on our blood vessels.\n",
      "Alcohol Consumption\n",
      "Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure to unhealthy levels. Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily increase blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increased blood pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have high blood pressure:\n",
      "1. Stick to a Healthy Diet. Avoid foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats such as animal fats, red meat (e.g. beef and lamb), coconut milk, palm oil.\n",
      "Instead, choose lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products.\n",
      "Increase your intake of fruits and vegetables.\n",
      "Limit salt intake to 2,000 mg of sodium per day, or about 1 teaspoon (about 5g) of salt daily.\n",
      "2. Exercise Regularly. Aim for at least 150 minutes light to moderate activity per week, 30 mins per day. Walking, swimming, dancing - anything that gets your heart pumping counts.\n",
      "3. Watch Your Weight. It has been proven that maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risk of high blood pressure.\n",
      "4. Quit Smoking. Not only can smoking raise your blood pressure, but it's also a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indication 2: Atrial Fibrillation (AF)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterised by rapid and irregular beating.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "It is the most common heart rhythm problem and can occur in patients of any age though it is more commonly seen in older patients. AF is not immediately life-threatening but may result in heart failure. AF also predisposes a patient to blood clot formation. In an event of clot embolisation from the heart to the brain, a stroke occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "This is caused by unusual electrical activity in the upper chambers (atria) of the heart which causes the lower chambers (ventricles) to beat quickly and irregularly.\n",
      "Risk factors include: existing heart conditions such as coronary artery disease and past heart attacks, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, obesity, excessive alcohol or caffeine, and smoking. People with family history of AF are more likely to suffer from the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have AF:\n",
      "1. Manage high blood pressure (hypertension): Taking medication and making lifestyle changes to manage hypertension reduces the risk of AF.\n",
      "2. Exercise regularly: Moderate-intensity exercise lowers blood pressure and reduces the risk of coronary artery disease that could lead to development AF.\n",
      "3. Eat a heart healthy diet: Eat more whole grains, vegetables and fruits and cut down on salt and solid fats. This reduces one's risk of medical conditions such as coronary artery disease which are associated with higher risks of experiencing AF.\n",
      "4. Maintain a healthy weight: One should aim to maintain a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) under 27 kg/m2. This will help to reduce the effects or complications associated with AF.\n",
      "5. Smoking cessation: Quitting smoking reduces the risks of AF.\n",
      "6. Managing stress: This reduces one's risk of experiencing an abnormal heart rhythm like AF. \n",
      "7. Reducing alcohol or caffeine consumption: Drinking too much caffeine or alcohol, especially binge drinking, can trigger incidences of AF.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indication 3: Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "Ischaemic heart disease, also known as coronary artery disease (CAD), occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (the coronary arteries) become hardened and narrowed as a result of the build-up of fatty deposits called plaque on their inner walls (atherosclerosis). As a result, it gets harder for the arteries to supply blood to the heart. Eventually, blood flow to the heart muscle is reduced and can cause chest pain (angina). A sudden, complete blockage can lead to a heart attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "Many people with this disease are not aware they have it, as it develops slowly and silently over decades. It can go virtually unnoticed until it produces a heart attack. Symptoms of IHD may include:\n",
      "Chest pain (angina)\n",
      "Shortness of breath\n",
      "Heaviness in the chest\n",
      "Pain in the jaw or down the arms\n",
      "Heartburn\n",
      "Nausea\n",
      "Vomiting\n",
      "Heavy sweating\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "The narrowing of coronary arteries is typically caused by atherosclerosis. Other contributory factors include spasms in the coronary vessels, diabetes, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, adverse physical reactions to mental stress, and heavy smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "You can prevent or slow down coronary artery disease by improving the health of your heart and blood vessels. Here are some heart healthy activities:\n",
      "1. Exercise at least 150 minutes a week, with moderate intensity exercise. Make moderate exercise a part of your daily routine. Regular physical activity is a great way to burn fat. It also releases natural chemicals such as endorphins and vasodilators that help to maintain healthy blood vessels.\n",
      "2. Get six to eight hours of sleep daily.\n",
      "3. Adopt a heart-healthy diet rich in wholegrains and fibre. Take two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables daily.\n",
      "4. Achieve and maintain a healthy BMI (Body Mass Index). The healthy range for Asians is from 18.5 to 22.9 kg/m2.\n",
      "Obesity or excess body fat, particularly around the waist, can also be a cause of increased blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.  A 2.5 to 5 kg weight loss can significantly reduce your risk of heart disease.\n",
      "5. Stop or not start on smokingIf you smoke, create a plan to stop. Smoking decreases the amount of oxygen delivered to the heart, and increases the risk of developing deadly blood clots. There are support groups you can contact to help encourage you, as well as medications to make stopping easier. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Indication 4: Heart Failure (HF)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "The heart is a very important organ that pumps blood to all parts of the body. In the more common cases of heart failure, the heart is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. Due to the abnormal function of the heart, patients with heart failure experience may experience other symptoms too, for example, difficulty breathing, fatigue, water retention, and high blood pressure. When left untreated, heart failure will worsen over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "There are two main ways by which heart function can become abnormal:\n",
      "More commonly, the heart which is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. Any disease condition or injury to the heart muscles, heart valves or electrical conduction system of the heart can damage and weaken the heart causing heart failure.\n",
      "Another way is a stiff heart that is unable to fill properly with blood even though it may still be able to \"pump\" well. This situation leads to increased pressures within the heart chambers and eventually in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing heart failure.\n",
      "Both conditions eventually cause a decrease in cardiac output and inadequate blood supply to the rest of the body. When this occurs, the body will compensate for the lack of blood supply through a number of ways.\n",
      "For instance, certain hormones and the nervous system (also known as the neurohormonal systems) become active, making the injured heart contract harder and faster. These systems also cause the kidneys to retain salt and fluid in order to increase blood volume, and also make the blood vessels in the body and limbs become narrower to increase blood pressure. While these processes may initially improve the heart function and cardiac output, in the long run, they damage the body and the heart, particularly if the heart remains injured. Altogether, these processes produce the syndrome of heart failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "One or a combination of these various conditions can cause the heart to function inefficiently:\n",
      "- Heart muscle damage due to heart attack or when the heart arteries become severely narrowed\n",
      "- Poorly controlled long-term high blood pressure\n",
      "- Faulty heart valves\n",
      "- Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle due to genetic causes, or damage to the heart muscle by external causes like a virus or alcohol)\n",
      "- Congenital heart disease (heart defects present since birth)\n",
      "- Infection of the heart and/or heart valves\n",
      "- Arrhythmia (heart rhythm disorder)\n",
      "- Certain toxins (alcohol, cocaine, certain chemotherapy drugs)\n",
      "- Other medical conditions (e.g. thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions, tumours affecting the heart, etc)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have heart failure:\n",
      "1. Eat less salt, cholesterol-rich food and saturated fat. Avoid egg yolks, organ meats, seafood (e.g. squid) as they contain high amounts of dietary cholesterol. Choose the healthier types of fat (unsaturated fats such as olive oil, corn oil and sunflower oil instead of saturated such as coconut oil). \n",
      "2. Eat more fibre as a high fibre diet (particularly soluble fibre) will improve your blood cholesterol level. Good sources of fibre are vegetables, fruits and whole grain\n",
      "3. You may need to limit your fluid intake if instructed by your doctor.\n",
      "4. Quit smoking if possible and limit alcohol beverages if possible.\n",
      "5. Many people can continue to carry out their daily activities and lead a relatively normal lifestyle, despite having a heart condition. If you had a recent heart failure event,  it is important that you return to your previous home, leisure and work activities gradually to help your heart to heal. Some energy conservation techniques you can try are:\n",
      "Approach your day calmly.\n",
      "Allow enough time for each task so that you do not have to rush.\n",
      "Plan realistically and prioritise the things you need to do for the day.\n",
      "Take short breaks and rest between tasks, even when not feeling tired\n",
      " \n",
      "6. Remain active as much as possible and continue to do the activities you enjoy. Heart failure can cause symptoms of breathlessness on exertion and muscle tiredness, thus do consult your doctor or therapist for the kind of exercise(s) that you can do safely and avoid overexertion. You may also find out more about cardiac rehabilitation, supervised exercise training and educational programmes.\n",
      "7. Monitor your weight daily as rapid weight gain may be a sign that you are retaining fluid or that your heart failure condition is getting worse. Try to weigh yourself in the morning (at the same time each day), after emptying your bladder and before breakfast. Wear the same amount of clothes each time you weigh yourself and record it daily in your diary or chart. Use the same weighing scale. Watch for sudden weight gain and contact your doctor if you suddenly gain more than 1 kg of weight a day for three days.\n",

      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "Our kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining the body's internal balance by adjusting the composition of the urine they produce, and are critical for our survival. 1) They regulate the amount of salt and water in the body, ensuring proper fluid balance, and 2) they eliminate waste products from the body through urine, helping to cleanse the system. Additionally, 3) the kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which is essential for the formation of adequate red blood cells. 4)They also contribute to bone health by converting vitamin D into its active form and regulating calcium and phosphate levels. 5) The kidneys help maintain the body's chemical balance by controlling acid levels and managing various minerals and salts.\n",

      "There are many reasons why a kidney stops working. Diabetes and high blood pressure are two major causes of kidney disease. Other risk factors include a family history of kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, older age and abnormal kidney structure. For many people, kidney failure is often the result of complications caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. Diabetic nephropathy is kidney failure resulting from long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes. When diabetes is poorly controlled and blood sugar levels are high, the kidney have to work extra hard to filter the blood, causing damage to the blood vessels in the kidney and decline in its filtering ability over time.\n",

      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have CKD:\n",
      "1. Opt for less sugar, salt, and fats when dining out. Consider home cooked meals to better control the amount of sugar and salt. Have a healthy diet with at least 2 servings of fruits and 2 servings of vegetables every day. Consider whole grains and lean meat.\n",
      "2. When kidney function starts to decrease, CKD patients may need to adjust their diet to prevent excess waste and fluid from building up. Diet modification varies for individuals due to their age, body size, symptoms, stage of CKD, activity level, and other health conditions. It is thus important to discuss with your doctor or dietician,  for example regarding the right amount of protein, phosphorous, potassium, sodium and fluids you should be consuming.   \n",
      "3. Quit smoking and limit alcohol. Smoking can damage your blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to the kidneys and reduce their ability to function normally. Smoking can also increase the risk of developing kidney cancer. Drinking too much alcohol can also increase blood pressure over time, which is one of the common causes of kidney disease.\n",
      "4. Maintain an active lifestyle to maintain a healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\n",

      "## Indication 3: Heart Failure (HF)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "The heart is a very important organ that pumps blood to all parts of the body. In the more common cases of heart failure, the heart is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. Due to the abnormal function of the heart, patients with heart failure experience may experience other symptoms too, for example, difficulty breathing, fatigue, water retention, and high blood pressure. When left untreated, heart failure will worsen over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "There are two main ways by which heart function can become abnormal:\n",
      "More commonly, the heart which is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. Any disease condition or injury to the heart muscles, heart valves or electrical conduction system of the heart can damage and weaken the heart causing heart failure.\n",
      "Another way is a stiff heart that is unable to fill properly with blood even though it may still be able to \"pump\" well. This situation leads to increased pressures within the heart chambers and eventually in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing heart failure.\n",
      "Both conditions eventually cause a decrease in cardiac output and inadequate blood supply to the rest of the body. When this occurs, the body will compensate for the lack of blood supply through a number of ways.\n",
      "For instance, certain hormones and the nervous system (also known as the neurohormonal systems) become active, making the injured heart contract harder and faster. These systems also cause the kidneys to retain salt and fluid in order to increase blood volume, and also make the blood vessels in the body and limbs become narrower to increase blood pressure. While these processes may initially improve the heart function and cardiac output, in the long run, they damage the body and the heart, particularly if the heart remains injured. Altogether, these processes produce the syndrome of heart failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "One or a combination of these various conditions can cause the heart to function inefficiently:\n",
      "- Heart muscle damage due to heart attack or when the heart arteries become severely narrowed\n",
      "- Poorly controlled long-term high blood pressure\n",
      "- Faulty heart valves\n",
      "- Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle due to genetic causes, or damage to the heart muscle by external causes like a virus or alcohol)\n",
      "- Congenital heart disease (heart defects present since birth)\n",
      "- Infection of the heart and/or heart valves\n",
      "- Arrhythmia (heart rhythm disorder)\n",
      "- Certain toxins (alcohol, cocaine, certain chemotherapy drugs)\n",
      "- Other medical conditions (e.g. thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions, tumours affecting the heart, etc)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have heart failure:\n",
      "1. Eat less salt, cholesterol-rich food and saturated fat. Avoid egg yolks, organ meats, seafood (e.g. squid) as they contain high amounts of dietary cholesterol. Choose the healthier types of fat (unsaturated fats such as olive oil, corn oil and sunflower oil instead of saturated such as coconut oil). \n",
      "2. Eat more fibre as a high fibre diet (particularly soluble fibre) will improve your blood cholesterol level. Good sources of fibre are vegetables, fruits and whole grain\n",
      "3. You may need to limit your fluid intake if instructed by your doctor.\n",
      "4. Quit smoking if possible and limit alcohol beverages if possible.\n",
      "5. Many people can continue to carry out their daily activities and lead a relatively normal lifestyle, despite having a heart condition. If you had a recent heart failure event,  it is important that you return to your previous home, leisure and work activities gradually to help your heart to heal. Some energy conservation techniques you can try are:\n",
      "Approach your day calmly.\n",
      "Allow enough time for each task so that you do not have to rush.\n",
      "Plan realistically and prioritise the things you need to do for the day.\n",
      "Take short breaks and rest between tasks, even when not feeling tired\n",
      " \n",
      "6. Remain active as much as possible and continue to do the activities you enjoy. Heart failure can cause symptoms of breathlessness on exertion and muscle tiredness, thus do consult your doctor or therapist for the kind of exercise(s) that you can do safely and avoid overexertion. You may also find out more about cardiac rehabilitation, supervised exercise training and educational programmes.\n",
      "7. Monitor your weight daily as rapid weight gain may be a sign that you are retaining fluid or that your heart failure condition is getting worse. Try to weigh yourself in the morning (at the same time each day), after emptying your bladder and before breakfast. Wear the same amount of clothes each time you weigh yourself and record it daily in your diary or chart. Use the same weighing scale. Watch for sudden weight gain and contact your doctor if you suddenly gain more than 1 kg of weight a day for three days.\n",

      "Diabetes means your blood sugar level is higher than normal. Type 2 Diabetes, is usually found in people aged 40 and above who are overweight and physically inactive. In some people, the condition is mild and they are able to control their blood glucose with just diet and exercise. However, if the condition gets worse, they may require oral medication or insulin injections in addition to making lifestyle changes.\n",

However, there may also be symptoms that develop gradually and are sometimes so mild they go unnoticed, such as the following: Having blurred vision, feeling thirsty despite drinking lots of water, poor healing of cuts and wounds, feeling tired, feeling hungry all the time, losing weight despite good appetite or frequent urination. The high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) levels in uncontrolled diabetes can damage both nerves and blood vessels. As blood vessels supply blood to various organs, this can eventually lead to complications such as: \n",

      "Type 2 Diabetes usually occurs when the body's cells do not respond well or are resistant to the body's own insulin. It is commonly associated with being overweight and having excessive body fat (under the skin and around the internal organs). Typically, it develops in older adults (risk increases for those above 40 years).\n",

      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have diabetes:\n",
      "1. Lose weight if you are overweight. Aim for a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging from 18.5 to 22.9kg/m2 to reduce the risk of heart disease and insulin resistance. \n",
      "2. Maintain an active lifestyle. This helps to maintain healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\n",
      "3. Follow the healthy plate concept which helps you remember the right proportions of each food group in a well-balanced meal. Here's how:\n",
      "Fill Quarter plate with wholegrains\n",
      "Fill Quarter plate with good sources of protein\n",
      "Fill Half plate with fruit and vegetables\n",
      "4. Eat more fibre-rich food. Fibre helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is being released into the bloodstream, keeps you full and improves bowel function.\n",
      "Include two servings each of fruit and vegetables daily.\n",
      "1 serving of fruit = 1 small apple or 1 wedge papaya or 10 grapes (small)\n",
      "1 serving of vegetables = 100g cooked vegetables (¾ mug) or 150g raw vegetable\n",
      "4. Include wholegrain products in your diet such as wholegrain or whole-meal bread, oats, chapati, brown rice, whole-meal biscuits etc.\n",
      "5. Have regular meals at similar timings each day. This provides a regular and constant amount of sugar from the food you eat to reduce fluctuations in your blood sugar level.\n",
      "This is also important for those on medications and/or insulin therapy to allow the action of the medication/insulin to match your food intake, hence preventing hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).\n",
      "6. Quit smoking as smoking increases insulin resistance, risk of diabetes and its complications.\n",

      "Avoid ice cream, cakes, chocolate with high fat content as it will take too long to increase your blood glucose levels:  Any item that requires a lot of prolonged chewing/sucking\n",
      "Step 2:\n",
      "Wait for 15 minutes, and then re-test your blood glucose.\n",
      "Step 3:\n",
      "If your blood glucose is still low (< 4.0 mmol/L), repeat steps 1 to 3. If your blood glucose is 4.0 mmol/L and above, proceed to step 4.\n",
      "Step 4:\n",
      "Blood glucose levels may fall again about 1 hour after you have treated your hypoglycaemia. If your next meal is more than 1 hour away, eat an additional snack containing 15g of longer-acting carbohydrates.\n",
      "Examples include: 3 pieces of biscuits, 1 slice of bread, \n",
      "Carry quick-acting carbohydrates with you at all times, so that you are always prepared to treat hypoglycemia.\n",
      "However, if hypoglycemia frequently occurs, please inform your doctor as your diabetes medicines may need to be adjusted.\n",
      "A family member or friend should take you to the hospital or call an ambulance (995) immediately if you:\n",
      "Continue to have low blood glucose (< 4.0 mmol/L) after repeated treatments with fast-acting carbohydrates\n",

      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a condition in which the heart has to pump harder for blood to flow through narrowed blood vessels, leading to persistently raised pressure. It usually does not have any noticeable signs, but it can be harmful to your health if not managed. If left unchecked or untreated, it can damage your blood vessels, heart, kidney, eye or other organs over time and cause serious complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "Blood pressure refers to the force of the body's blood pushing against the inner walls of the blood vessels, especially the arteries. Each time the heart contracts, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure doesn't stay constant throughout the day. It is lowest when you're sleeping, and rises when you get up and start moving about. It can also go up when you are excited, nervous or physically active. \n",
      "Blood pressure (BP) readings are expressed as a ratio of the systolic pressure (the first number or numerator), over the diastolic pressure (the second number or denominator). A blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg (millimetres of mercury) is expressed verbally as 120 over 80.\n",
      "A healthy blood pressure reading should be lower than 120/80 mmHg. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg diastolic, and may vary from 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg in a healthy young woman. A blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher indicates high blood pressure.\n",

      "Age\n",
      "As we grow older, our arteries may stiffen and narrow due to the build-up of plaque over the years, causing the heart to beat harder, thus developing high blood pressure.\n",

      "The heavier we are, the more blood is required to supply oxygen and nutrients around our body, thus increasing the pressure on our blood vessels.\n",
      "Alcohol Consumption\n",

      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have high blood pressure:\n",
      "1. Stick to a Healthy Diet. Avoid foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats such as animal fats, red meat (e.g. beef and lamb), coconut milk, palm oil.\n",
      "Instead, choose lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products.\n",
      "Increase your intake of fruits and vegetables.\n",
      "Limit salt intake to 2,000 mg of sodium per day, or about 1 teaspoon (about 5g) of salt daily.\n",
      "2. Exercise Regularly. Aim for at least 150 minutes light to moderate activity per week, 30 mins per day. Walking, swimming, dancing - anything that gets your heart pumping counts.\n",
      "3. Watch Your Weight. It has been proven that maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risk of high blood pressure.\n",
      "4. Quit Smoking. Not only can smoking raise your blood pressure, but it's also a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke.\n",

      "People with Type 2 diabetes can feel well and not experience any symptoms at all. However, there may also be symptoms that develop gradually and are sometimes so mild they go unnoticed, such as the following: Having blurred vision, feeling thirsty despite drinking lots of water, poor healing of cuts and wounds, feeling tired, feeling hungry all the time, losing weight despite good appetite or frequent urination. The high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) levels in uncontrolled diabetes can damage both nerves and blood vessels. As blood vessels supply blood to various organs, this can eventually lead to complications such as: \n",

      "Type 2 Diabetes usually occurs when the body's cells do not respond well or are resistant to the body's own insulin. It is commonly associated with being overweight and having excessive body fat (under the skin and around the internal organs). Typically, it develops in older adults (risk increases for those above 40 years).\n",

      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have diabetes:\n",
      "1. Lose weight if you are overweight. Aim for a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging from 18.5 to 22.9kg/m2 to reduce the risk of heart disease and insulin resistance. \n",
      "2. Maintain an active lifestyle. This helps to maintain healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\n",

      "Fill Quarter plate with wholegrains\n",
      "Fill Quarter plate with good sources of protein\n",
      "Fill Half plate with fruit and vegetables\n",
      "4. Eat more fibre-rich food. Fibre helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is being released into the bloodstream, keeps you full and improves bowel function.\n",
      "Include two servings each of fruit and vegetables daily.\n",
      "1 serving of fruit = 1 small apple or 1 wedge papaya or 10 grapes (small)\n",
      "1 serving of vegetables = 100g cooked vegetables (¾ mug) or 150g raw vegetable\n",
      "4. Include wholegrain products in your diet such as wholegrain or whole-meal bread, oats, chapati, brown rice, whole-meal biscuits etc.\n",
      "5. Have regular meals at similar timings each day. This provides a regular and constant amount of sugar from the food you eat to reduce fluctuations in your blood sugar level.\n",
      "This is also important for those on medications and/or insulin therapy to allow the action of the medication/insulin to match your food intake, hence preventing hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).\n",
      "6. Quit smoking as smoking increases insulin resistance, risk of diabetes and its complications.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a condition in which the heart has to pump harder for blood to flow through narrowed blood vessels, leading to persistently raised pressure. It usually does not have any noticeable signs, but it can be harmful to your health if not managed. If left unchecked or untreated, it can damage your blood vessels, heart, kidney, eye or other organs over time and cause serious complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "Blood pressure refers to the force of the body's blood pushing against the inner walls of the blood vessels, especially the arteries. Each time the heart contracts, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure doesn't stay constant throughout the day. It is lowest when you're sleeping, and rises when you get up and start moving about. It can also go up when you are excited, nervous or physically active. \n",
      "Blood pressure (BP) readings are expressed as a ratio of the systolic pressure (the first number or numerator), over the diastolic pressure (the second number or denominator). A blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg (millimetres of mercury) is expressed verbally as 120 over 80.\n",
      "A healthy blood pressure reading should be lower than 120/80 mmHg. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg diastolic, and may vary from 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg in a healthy young woman. A blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher indicates high blood pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "The most common type of high blood pressure is essential hypertension, and it develops over time, usually aused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle-related risk factors. \n",
      "Age\n",
      "As we grow older, our arteries may stiffen and narrow due to the build-up of plaque over the years, causing the heart to beat harder, thus developing high blood pressure.\n",
      "Smoking\n",
      "Smoking can raise our blood pressure temporarily and its chemicals can damage our artery walls, causing our arteries to narrow and stiffen.\n",
      "Unhealthy Diet\n",
      "A diet high in fat, sugar, or sodium can increase our risk of developing hypertension.\n",
      "Physical Inactivity\n",
      "Individuals who lead sedentary lifestyles tend to have a higher heart rate than those who are physically active. This means that the heart needs to work harder.\n",
      "Obesity/Overweight\n",
      "The heavier we are, the more blood is required to supply oxygen and nutrients around our body, thus increasing the pressure on our blood vessels.\n",
      "Alcohol Consumption\n",
      "Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure to unhealthy levels. Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily increase blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increased blood pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have high blood pressure:\n",
      "1. Stick to a Healthy Diet. Avoid foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats such as animal fats, red meat (e.g. beef and lamb), coconut milk, palm oil.\n",
      "Instead, choose lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products.\n",
      "Increase your intake of fruits and vegetables.\n",
      "Limit salt intake to 2,000 mg of sodium per day, or about 1 teaspoon (about 5g) of salt daily.\n",
      "2. Exercise Regularly. Aim for at least 150 minutes light to moderate activity per week, 30 mins per day. Walking, swimming, dancing - anything that gets your heart pumping counts.\n",
      "3. Watch Your Weight. It has been proven that maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risk of high blood pressure.\n",
      "4. Quit Smoking. Not only can smoking raise your blood pressure, but it's also a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke.\n",

      "# Mechanism of Action & How it Works / Helps\n",
      "Telmisartan lowers blood pressure by blocking the effects of a substance called Angiotensin II at the blood vessel walls. This causes the blood vessels to become wider and decrease blood pressure. This medication has additional protective effect on your heart and kidneys as well.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Indication 1: Hypertension (HTN)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a condition in which the heart has to pump harder for blood to flow through narrowed blood vessels, leading to persistently raised pressure. It usually does not have any noticeable signs, but it can be harmful to your health if not managed. If left unchecked or untreated, it can damage your blood vessels, heart, kidney, eye or other organs over time and cause serious complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "Blood pressure refers to the force of the body's blood pushing against the inner walls of the blood vessels, especially the arteries. Each time the heart contracts, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure doesn't stay constant throughout the day. It is lowest when you're sleeping, and rises when you get up and start moving about. It can also go up when you are excited, nervous or physically active. \n",
      "Blood pressure (BP) readings are expressed as a ratio of the systolic pressure (the first number or numerator), over the diastolic pressure (the second number or denominator). A blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg (millimetres of mercury) is expressed verbally as 120 over 80.\n",
      "A healthy blood pressure reading should be lower than 120/80 mmHg. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg diastolic, and may vary from 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg in a healthy young woman. A blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher indicates high blood pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "The most common type of high blood pressure is essential hypertension, and it develops over time, usually aused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle-related risk factors. \n",
      "Age\n",
      "As we grow older, our arteries may stiffen and narrow due to the build-up of plaque over the years, causing the heart to beat harder, thus developing high blood pressure.\n",
      "Smoking\n",
      "Smoking can raise our blood pressure temporarily and its chemicals can damage our artery walls, causing our arteries to narrow and stiffen.\n",
      "Unhealthy Diet\n",
      "A diet high in fat, sugar, or sodium can increase our risk of developing hypertension.\n",
      "Physical Inactivity\n",
      "Individuals who lead sedentary lifestyles tend to have a higher heart rate than those who are physically active. This means that the heart needs to work harder.\n",
      "Obesity/Overweight\n",
      "The heavier we are, the more blood is required to supply oxygen and nutrients around our body, thus increasing the pressure on our blood vessels.\n",
      "Alcohol Consumption\n",
      "Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure to unhealthy levels. Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily increase blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increased blood pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have high blood pressure:\n",
      "1. Stick to a Healthy Diet. Avoid foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats such as animal fats, red meat (e.g. beef and lamb), coconut milk, palm oil.\n",
      "Instead, choose lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products.\n",
      "Increase your intake of fruits and vegetables.\n",
      "Limit salt intake to 2,000 mg of sodium per day, or about 1 teaspoon (about 5g) of salt daily.\n",
      "2. Exercise Regularly. Aim for at least 150 minutes light to moderate activity per week, 30 mins per day. Walking, swimming, dancing - anything that gets your heart pumping counts.\n",
      "3. Watch Your Weight. It has been proven that maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risk of high blood pressure.\n",
      "4. Quit Smoking. Not only can smoking raise your blood pressure, but it's also a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "Diabetes means your blood sugar level is higher than normal. Type 2 Diabetes, is usually found in people aged 40 and above who are overweight and physically inactive. In some people, the condition is mild and they are able to control their blood glucose with just diet and exercise. However, if the condition gets worse, they may require oral medication or insulin injections in addition to making lifestyle changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "People with Type 2 diabetes can feel well and not experience any symptoms at all. However, there may also be symptoms that develop gradually and are sometimes so mild they go unnoticed, such as the following: Having blurred vision, feeling thirsty despite drinking lots of water, poor healing of cuts and wounds, feeling tired, feeling hungry all the time, losing weight despite good appetite or frequent urination. The high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) levels in uncontrolled diabetes can damage both nerves and blood vessels. As blood vessels supply blood to various organs, this can eventually lead to complications such as: \n",
      "Kidney disease\n",
      "Foot disease such as numbness, ulcers, and even gangrene\n",
      "Eye disease\n",
      "Nerve disease which can lead to problems such as erectile dysfunction and diarrhoea\n",
      "Heart disease such as angina and heart attack\n",
      "Stroke\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "Type 2 Diabetes usually occurs when the body's cells do not respond well or are resistant to the body's own insulin. It is commonly associated with being overweight and having excessive body fat (under the skin and around the internal organs). Typically, it develops in older adults (risk increases for those above 40 years).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have diabetes:\n",
      "1. Lose weight if you are overweight. Aim for a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging from 18.5 to 22.9kg/m2 to reduce the risk of heart disease and insulin resistance. \n",
      "2. Maintain an active lifestyle. This helps to maintain healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\n",
      "3. Follow the healthy plate concept which helps you remember the right proportions of each food group in a well-balanced meal. Here's how:\n",
      "Fill Quarter plate with wholegrains\n",
      "Fill Quarter plate with good sources of protein\n",
      "Fill Half plate with fruit and vegetables\n",
      "4. Eat more fibre-rich food. Fibre helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is being released into the bloodstream, keeps you full and improves bowel function.\n",
      "Include two servings each of fruit and vegetables daily.\n",
      "1 serving of fruit = 1 small apple or 1 wedge papaya or 10 grapes (small)\n",
      "1 serving of vegetables = 100g cooked vegetables (¾ mug) or 150g raw vegetable\n",
      "4. Include wholegrain products in your diet such as wholegrain or whole-meal bread, oats, chapati, brown rice, whole-meal biscuits etc.\n",
      "5. Have regular meals at similar timings each day. This provides a regular and constant amount of sugar from the food you eat to reduce fluctuations in your blood sugar level.\n",
      "This is also important for those on medications and/or insulin therapy to allow the action of the medication/insulin to match your food intake, hence preventing hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).\n",
      "6. Quit smoking as smoking increases insulin resistance, risk of diabetes and its complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indication 2: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is due to the gradual loss of the kidneys' filtering ability, usually due to high blood pressure or diabetes. When kidney function is seriously impaired, dangerously high levels of fluid and wastes can accumulate in the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "Our kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining the body's internal balance by adjusting the composition of the urine they produce, and are critical for our survival. 1) They regulate the amount of salt and water in the body, ensuring proper fluid balance, and 2) they eliminate waste products from the body through urine, helping to cleanse the system. Additionally, 3) the kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which is essential for the formation of adequate red blood cells. 4)They also contribute to bone health by converting vitamin D into its active form and regulating calcium and phosphate levels. 5) The kidneys help maintain the body's chemical balance by controlling acid levels and managing various minerals and salts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "There are many reasons why a kidney stops working. Diabetes and high blood pressure are two major causes of kidney disease. Other risk factors include a family history of kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, older age and abnormal kidney structure. For many people, kidney failure is often the result of complications caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. Diabetic nephropathy is kidney failure resulting from long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes. When diabetes is poorly controlled and blood sugar levels are high, the kidney have to work extra hard to filter the blood, causing damage to the blood vessels in the kidney and decline in its filtering ability over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "The main goal of CKD treatment is to halt or delay the progression of the disease, usually by controlling the underlying cause such as controlling high blood pressure and diabetes. CKD can progressively worsen over time and end up with kidney failure, which can be fatal if not treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. \n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have CKD:\n",
      "1. Opt for less sugar, salt, and fats when dining out. Consider home cooked meals to better control the amount of sugar and salt. Have a healthy diet with at least 2 servings of fruits and 2 servings of vegetables every day. Consider whole grains and lean meat.\n",
      "2. When kidney function starts to decrease, CKD patients may need to adjust their diet to prevent excess waste and fluid from building up. Diet modification varies for individuals due to their age, body size, symptoms, stage of CKD, activity level, and other health conditions. It is thus important to discuss with your doctor or dietician,  for example regarding the right amount of protein, phosphorous, potassium, sodium and fluids you should be consuming.   \n",
      "3. Quit smoking and limit alcohol. Smoking can damage your blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to the kidneys and reduce their ability to function normally. Smoking can also increase the risk of developing kidney cancer. Drinking too much alcohol can also increase blood pressure over time, which is one of the common causes of kidney disease.\n",
      "4. Maintain an active lifestyle to maintain a healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Indication 3: Heart Failure (HF)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary Of Disease Condition\n",
      "The heart is a very important organ that pumps blood to all parts of the body. In the more common cases of heart failure, the heart is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. Due to the abnormal function of the heart, patients with heart failure experience may experience other symptoms too, for example, difficulty breathing, fatigue, water retention, and high blood pressure. When left untreated, heart failure will worsen over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information On Disease\n",
      "There are two main ways by which heart function can become abnormal:\n",
      "More commonly, the heart which is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. Any disease condition or injury to the heart muscles, heart valves or electrical conduction system of the heart can damage and weaken the heart causing heart failure.\n",
      "Another way is a stiff heart that is unable to fill properly with blood even though it may still be able to \"pump\" well. This situation leads to increased pressures within the heart chambers and eventually in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing heart failure.\n",
      "Both conditions eventually cause a decrease in cardiac output and inadequate blood supply to the rest of the body. When this occurs, the body will compensate for the lack of blood supply through a number of ways.\n",
      "For instance, certain hormones and the nervous system (also known as the neurohormonal systems) become active, making the injured heart contract harder and faster. These systems also cause the kidneys to retain salt and fluid in order to increase blood volume, and also make the blood vessels in the body and limbs become narrower to increase blood pressure. While these processes may initially improve the heart function and cardiac output, in the long run, they damage the body and the heart, particularly if the heart remains injured. Altogether, these processes produce the syndrome of heart failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Disease Aetiology\n",
      "One or a combination of these various conditions can cause the heart to function inefficiently:\n",
      "- Heart muscle damage due to heart attack or when the heart arteries become severely narrowed\n",
      "- Poorly controlled long-term high blood pressure\n",
      "- Faulty heart valves\n",
      "- Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle due to genetic causes, or damage to the heart muscle by external causes like a virus or alcohol)\n",
      "- Congenital heart disease (heart defects present since birth)\n",
      "- Infection of the heart and/or heart valves\n",
      "- Arrhythmia (heart rhythm disorder)\n",
      "- Certain toxins (alcohol, cocaine, certain chemotherapy drugs)\n",
      "- Other medical conditions (e.g. thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions, tumours affecting the heart, etc)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non Pharmacological Counselling\n",
      "Here are some lifestyle tips if you have heart failure:\n",
      "1. Eat less salt, cholesterol-rich food and saturated fat. Avoid egg yolks, organ meats, seafood (e.g. squid) as they contain high amounts of dietary cholesterol. Choose the healthier types of fat (unsaturated fats such as olive oil, corn oil and sunflower oil instead of saturated such as coconut oil). \n",
      "2. Eat more fibre as a high fibre diet (particularly soluble fibre) will improve your blood cholesterol level. Good sources of fibre are vegetables, fruits and whole grain\n",
      "3. You may need to limit your fluid intake if instructed by your doctor.\n",
      "4. Quit smoking if possible and limit alcohol beverages if possible.\n",
      "5. Many people can continue to carry out their daily activities and lead a relatively normal lifestyle, despite having a heart condition. If you had a recent heart failure event,  it is important that you return to your previous home, leisure and work activities gradually to help your heart to heal. Some energy conservation techniques you can try are:\n",
      "Approach your day calmly.\n",
      "Allow enough time for each task so that you do not have to rush.\n",
      "Plan realistically and prioritise the things you need to do for the day.\n",
      "Take short breaks and rest between tasks, even when not feeling tired\n",
      " \n",
      "6. Remain active as much as possible and continue to do the activities you enjoy. Heart failure can cause symptoms of breathlessness on exertion and muscle tiredness, thus do consult your doctor or therapist for the kind of exercise(s) that you can do safely and avoid overexertion. You may also find out more about cardiac rehabilitation, supervised exercise training and educational programmes.\n",
      "7. Monitor your weight daily as rapid weight gain may be a sign that you are retaining fluid or that your heart failure condition is getting worse. Try to weigh yourself in the morning (at the same time each day), after emptying your bladder and before breakfast. Wear the same amount of clothes each time you weigh yourself and record it daily in your diary or chart. Use the same weighing scale. Watch for sudden weight gain and contact your doctor if you suddenly gain more than 1 kg of weight a day for three days.\n",

However, there may also be symptoms that develop gradually and are sometimes so mild they go unnoticed, such as the following: Having blurred vision, feeling thirsty despite drinking lots of water, poor healing of cuts and wounds, feeling tired, feeling hungry all the time, losing weight despite good appetite or frequent urination. The high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) levels in uncontrolled diabetes can damage both nerves and blood vessels. As blood vessels supply blood to various organs, this can eventually lead to complications such as: \\nKidney disease\\nFoot disease such as numbness, ulcers, and even gangrene\\nEye disease\\nNerve disease which can lead to problems such as erectile dysfunction and diarrhoea\\nHeart disease such as angina and heart attack\\nStroke\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nType 2 Diabetes usually occurs when the body\\'s cells do not respond well or are resistant to the body\\'s own insulin. It is commonly associated with being overweight and having excessive body fat (under the skin and around the internal organs). Typically, it develops in older adults (risk increases for those above 40 years).\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have diabetes:\\n1. Lose weight if you are overweight. Aim for a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging from 18.5 to 22.9kg/m2 to reduce the risk of heart disease and insulin resistance. \\n2. Maintain an active lifestyle. This helps to maintain healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\\n3. Follow the healthy plate concept which helps you remember the right proportions of each food group in a well-balanced meal. Here\\'s how:\\nFill Quarter plate with wholegrains\\nFill Quarter plate with good sources of protein\\nFill Half plate with fruit and vegetables\\n4. Eat more fibre-rich food. Fibre helps to slow down the rate at which sugar is being released into the bloodstream, keeps you full and improves bowel function.\\nInclude two servings each of fruit and vegetables daily.\\n1 serving of fruit = 1 small apple or 1 wedge papaya or 10 grapes (small)\\n1 serving of vegetables = 100g cooked vegetables (¾ mug) or 150g raw vegetable\\n4. Include wholegrain products in your diet such as wholegrain or whole-meal bread, oats, chapati, brown rice, whole-meal biscuits etc.\\n5. Have regular meals at similar timings each day. This provides a regular and constant amount of sugar from the food you eat to reduce fluctuations in your blood sugar level.\\nThis is also important for those on medications and/or insulin therapy to allow the action of the medication/insulin to match your food intake, hence preventing hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).\\n6. Quit smoking as smoking increases insulin resistance, risk of diabetes and its complications.\\n\\n## Indication 2: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is due to the gradual loss of the kidneys\\' filtering ability, usually due to high blood pressure or diabetes. When kidney function is seriously impaired, dangerously high levels of fluid and wastes can accumulate in the body.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nOur kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining the body\\'s internal balance by adjusting the composition of the urine they produce, and are critical for our survival. 1) They regulate the amount of salt and water in the body, ensuring proper fluid balance, and 2) they eliminate waste products from the body through urine, helping to cleanse the system. Additionally, 3) the kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which is essential for the formation of adequate red blood cells. 4)They also contribute to bone health by converting vitamin D into its active form and regulating calcium and phosphate levels. 5) The kidneys help maintain the body\\'s chemical balance by controlling acid levels and managing various minerals and salts.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nThere are many reasons why a kidney stops working. Diabetes and high blood pressure are two major causes of kidney disease. Other risk factors include a family history of kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, older age and abnormal kidney structure. For many people, kidney failure is often the result of complications caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. Diabetic nephropathy is kidney failure resulting from long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes. When diabetes is poorly controlled and blood sugar levels are high, the kidney have to work extra hard to filter the blood, causing damage to the blood vessels in the kidney and decline in its filtering ability over time.\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nThe main goal of CKD treatment is to halt or delay the progression of the disease, usually by controlling the underlying cause such as controlling high blood pressure and diabetes. CKD can progressively worsen over time and end up with kidney failure, which can be fatal if not treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. \\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have CKD:\\n1. Opt for less sugar, salt, and fats when dining out. Consider home cooked meals to better control the amount of sugar and salt. Have a healthy diet with at least 2 servings of fruits and 2 servings of vegetables every day. Consider whole grains and lean meat.\\n2. When kidney function starts to decrease, CKD patients may need to adjust their diet to prevent excess waste and fluid from building up. Diet modification varies for individuals due to their age, body size, symptoms, stage of CKD, activity level, and other health conditions. It is thus important to discuss with your doctor or dietician,  for example regarding the right amount of protein, phosphorous, potassium, sodium and fluids you should be consuming.   \\n3. Quit smoking and limit alcohol. Smoking can damage your blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to the kidneys and reduce their ability to function normally. Smoking can also increase the risk of developing kidney cancer. Drinking too much alcohol can also increase blood pressure over time, which is one of the common causes of kidney disease.\\n4. Maintain an active lifestyle to maintain a healthy body weight. Engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week e.g. brisk walking, cycling, jogging, swimming, dancing where possible or as advised by your doctor.\\n\\n## Indication 3: Heart Failure (HF)\\n\\n### Summary Of Disease Condition\\nThe heart is a very important organ that pumps blood to all parts of the body. In the more common cases of heart failure, the heart is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s demands. Due to the abnormal function of the heart, patients with heart failure experience may experience other symptoms too, for example, difficulty breathing, fatigue, water retention, and high blood pressure. When left untreated, heart failure will worsen over time.\\n\\n### Additional Information On Disease\\nThere are two main ways by which heart function can become abnormal:\\nMore commonly, the heart which is weak is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body\\'s demands. Any disease condition or injury to the heart muscles, heart valves or electrical conduction system of the heart can damage and weaken the heart causing heart failure.\\nAnother way is a stiff heart that is unable to fill properly with blood even though it may still be able to \"pump\" well. This situation leads to increased pressures within the heart chambers and eventually in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing heart failure.\\nBoth conditions eventually cause a decrease in cardiac output and inadequate blood supply to the rest of the body. When this occurs, the body will compensate for the lack of blood supply through a number of ways.\\nFor instance, certain hormones and the nervous system (also known as the neurohormonal systems) become active, making the injured heart contract harder and faster. These systems also cause the kidneys to retain salt and fluid in order to increase blood volume, and also make the blood vessels in the body and limbs become narrower to increase blood pressure. While these processes may initially improve the heart function and cardiac output, in the long run, they damage the body and the heart, particularly if the heart remains injured. Altogether, these processes produce the syndrome of heart failure.\\n\\n### Disease Aetiology\\nOne or a combination of these various conditions can cause the heart to function inefficiently:\\n- Heart muscle damage due to heart attack or when the heart arteries become severely narrowed\\n- Poorly controlled long-term high blood pressure\\n- Faulty heart valves\\n- Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle due to genetic causes, or damage to the heart muscle by external causes like a virus or alcohol)\\n- Congenital heart disease (heart defects present since birth)\\n- Infection of the heart and/or heart valves\\n- Arrhythmia (heart rhythm disorder)\\n- Certain toxins (alcohol, cocaine, certain chemotherapy drugs)\\n- Other medical conditions (e.g. thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions, tumours affecting the heart, etc)\\n\\n### Non Pharmacological Counselling\\nHere are some lifestyle tips if you have heart failure:\\n1. Eat less salt, cholesterol-rich food and saturated fat. Avoid egg yolks, organ meats, seafood (e.g. squid) as they contain high amounts of dietary cholesterol. Choose the healthier types of fat (unsaturated fats such as olive oil, corn oil and sunflower oil instead of saturated such as coconut oil). \\n2. Eat more fibre as a high fibre diet (particularly soluble fibre) will improve your blood cholesterol level. Good sources of fibre are vegetables, fruits and whole grain\\n3. You may need to limit your fluid intake if instructed by your doctor.\\n4. Quit smoking if possible and limit alcohol beverages if possible.\\n5. Many people can continue to carry out their daily activities and lead a relatively normal lifestyle, despite having a heart condition. If you had a recent heart failure event,  it is important that you return to your previous home, leisure and work activities gradually to help your heart to heal. Some energy conservation techniques you can try are:\\nApproach your day calmly.\\nAllow enough time for each task so that you do not have to rush.\\nPlan realistically and prioritise the things you need to do for the day.\\nTake short breaks and rest between tasks, even when not feeling tired\\n \\n6. Remain active as much as possible and continue to do the activities you enjoy. Heart failure can cause symptoms of breathlessness on exertion and muscle tiredness, thus do consult your doctor or therapist for the kind of exercise(s) that you can do safely and avoid overexertion. You may also find out more about cardiac rehabilitation, supervised exercise training and educational programmes.\\n7. Monitor your weight daily as rapid weight gain may be a sign that you are retaining fluid or that your heart failure condition is getting worse. Try to weigh yourself in the morning (at the same time each day), after emptying your bladder and before breakfast. Wear the same amount of clothes each time you weigh yourself and record it daily in your diary or chart. Use the same weighing scale. Watch for sudden weight gain and contact your doctor if you suddenly gain more than 1 kg of weight a day for three days.'),\n",
